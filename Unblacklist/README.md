simply launch the script, enter the IP address, and here you go!


# 2019.03.05 - V0.1b - First release
###### Tested with 3CX V15, up to 3CX V16
First release is made in bash shell. Very simple, but I needed something quick. 
Down the road, we might switch to Python or Perl..

# 2023.03.01 - No more maintenance
Due to the disaster the latest 3CX V18U6 has been, we decided to move our customers away from 3CX to FreePBX
Therefore, this shell script won't be maintained anymore. Feel free to fork!
